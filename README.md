# Codewarrior

In this repository I collect some of my Katas, which I solved during the 'Advanced Module' and 'Jobhunt Phase' in my time at the Codecool Full Stack Course.

## Structure

The collection is a simple Java Maven project.

All Katas are to be found under the src/main/java/org/codewarrior path.

All Tests are to be found under src/test/java.

Above every class there is a comment with description of the task and a link to the Kata on Codewars.
